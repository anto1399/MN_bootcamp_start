    <p>
      Hello World, I am Daniella and I am a software developer. I am a law
      graduate yep I know you're asking what a law grad is doing as a software
      developer. Well that's the beauty of life. Tech world is full of people
      from unconb=ventional background. I made a committement to learn coding
      and here I am writing an html. hehehe.
    </p>
    <p>Right now I am working on github and contributiong to a souce code. The first time I wrote a line of code was in college while pursuing my LLB degree. The excitement and fulfillment were undeniably what sparked my interest in computing and technologies. I had taken personal lessons with a colleague in the Computer Science program to learn html and I totally fell in love with the basic syntax and the <Hello, World> line so much that I desired to be a tech savvy. </p>
